man <command_name> : Shows the manual page of the command 
$SHELL : Access the value of a variable called 'SHELL'

counter=1 : Sets the value of 1 to a variable called counter
echo ${counter} : Enclosing the variable name with curly brackets makes sure the shell knows where the variable name ends
printenv : Shows all the environment variables (writtern generally in all caps)
export base=/home/ghuli : Create your own environment variable


Commands:
which <command_name>: Displays the address where the command is stored(for example : which grep)
ls -al : list the files & folders(including hidden(-a)) in the current directory with permissions, size,...(-l)
tab completion : Completes the file or command name, might as well use double tab in case more than one option exis
history : Shows all the commands run on the device up to now 
!-n : runs the nth previous command(you can see the n from executing history command)
!n : Command number n in the history
!gi : Runs the last command that started with "gi"

Search the history:
	history

	return key: executes the found term(in history)
	ESC : put the search result on the regular command line
	ctrl+c : get out of the search history
($ ls) : substitutes the results of a command for use by another command
alias q=exit : With this command, instead of typing "exit" to get out of the program, a simple "q" can do the trick.
		(alias allows you to use the abbreviation for a command)
To undo alias: use "\" before the defined alias, for example if alias ls="ls -F" and want to have the 'ls' to act normal , one should type '\' before it
